# CanalNetwork (Drain) Test Protocol

Objectives:

- to test existing functions: To test all the existing functions in the product - as listed further below - and identify areas where:
  
  - operations succed and fail, or 
  
  - unexpected results are encountered, or
  
  -  where the outputs do not meet expected level of detail/accuracy.

- to suggest better functional organization/scope. Some existing functions may need to be reformulated or rearranged to better serve the routine needs of the engineer. Testing engineers may suggest such changes at the end of their test excercise, to be considered for integration.

- Propose new functionalities, as may be needed, to make the product usable for common drainage network design tasks. This will be relevant where funcitonal modifications above are not adquate solutions.



There are three areas of the design workflow proposed for testing. Under each category, specific functionality tests are listed. The test engineer will excercise each functionality, and document findings. Some tests may require joint work and technical assistance, and this is expected.



At the end of the test excercise, the documented findings on changes to functions/funcitonalities will be forwarded to the the Partner for integration. In some instances, deliberation with Panel of Senior Engineers may be required, before the partner commits resources to tackle the proposed changes. This is also expected, and part of the development process.





## Network resolution and Sizing

Routes partial import

Naming, and Design criteria settings including command duty

Node ID and Resolution (Should work similar to supply network counter part)

Create Route naming, set exceptions, 

Create, edit and apply farm blocks
