## Major updates and funtionalities

Major feature updates and functionalities for this release include:

- New function to over ride canal route capacity, to account for rotational water supply options that may be required on certain canals.

* New function to automatically reverse canal route alignments in AutoCAD, in preparation for network resolution and profile extraction.

- New feature for editing Auto-generated farmblocks in AutoCAD and updating workspace data.

- Improved subroute selection feature, to handle route selections flexibly for various tasks. The use can now specify explicitly which levels of sub-routes to select for further processing- for instance, BoQ generattion, Drawing production, or Design Criteria (Discharge) override.
- Improved canal top provission specification, allowing to automactically position provissions depending on natural gradient. This eliminates the need for the user to specify conditions for each route one by one, contributing to design speed and saving much time for the designer.
- Improved canal route exception handling and management, allowing to accomodate specified naming prefix/suffix settings.

* Bug fixes on exception handling, naming texts, and plan view markers orientations.

Previous updates included:

- Improved zoom funcitonality(CTRL+Scroll) for constrained zooming ability
- Up to 7X speed and accuracy on key workflows (Profile generation, Node Identification and resolution)
- Integration some iCAD tools to CanalNETWORK for enhanced design production quality and speed: namely Plan view generation, extended cross-sections and more.
- Improved control of drop design for longitudinal design work
- Improved performance and design production of canal structures: Head Regulators, Cross-regulators, and Inclined Drops.
- A small bug fix on LSec generation (drop scheduling and vertical scaling) for CanalNETWORK product  is included as of Sep29th, 22.
- A bug for profile extraction handling instance objects refering to null data (Oct5th, 2022)
- Visual elements for interactive view, dynamically tracking marker location in profile view to layout view area.
- Allow update of plan view generation data by segments, avoiding the need to update the entire route for small changes. Now user only needs to update the segment where the change was made.
- Summary of BoQ function included to generate highlevel summary of items for similar generation(levels) of canals.
- Natural sorting algorithm included for intutive display of results in Canal Naming, Farmblock tables, and LSec drawing generations.
- Alternate CsV file option for iCAD now included, the same as CanalNETWORK product, allowing data strealining and storage reduction.
